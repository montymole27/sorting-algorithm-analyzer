# Sorting-Algorithm-Analyzer

# Introduction
The Sorting Algorithm Analyzer was created by me and the Replit AI for the 2025 Bitcamp Hackathon at University of Maryland. I wanted to create a website that talks about different sorting algorithms. On the main home page, users enter in a number of integers separated by commas that they want to input (think of it like a list/array of data). The user can also hit the rotating arrows symbol for the code to automatically input a list of integers for them. There are two dropown menus.

1. <ins>**Custom Data Size**</ins>
   - **Small:** allows a length of up to 20 integers.
   - **Medium:** allows a length of up to 100 integers.
   - **Large:** allows a length of up to 1,000 integers.
   - **Extra Large:** allows a length of up to 10,000 integers.
2. <ins>**Initial Data Order**</ins>
