# Sorting Algorithm Analyzer
An interactive web application for visualizing, comparing, and learning about various sorting algorithms. This project combines animation, algorithm education, and performance metrics in a clean, modern interface.

## Features
- **Real-time visualizations** of classic sorting algorithms.
- **Informative descriptions** and time-complexity badges.
- **Responsive, accessible UI** built in with modern components.
- **Compare preformance** by algorithm type and data set.
- **API-driven archetecture** with ReactQuery and TypeScript.

## Demo
Coming soon... unless I'm too lazy. It might also be on the Devpost.

## Tech Stack
- **Front End:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Routing:** Wouter
